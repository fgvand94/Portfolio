	<!-- just thinking of ideas of things to put in a forum like this. I chose to create a forum as practice because I felt like forums have a fair level of compllexity. I could practice linking to different areas, creating search engines for my site, forms and login information that people could fill in and different things like that. It seems like good practice for a wide range of skills and topics within css and html. I just need to think of actual catogories for discussion within my moc forum. I mean genral environmental conservation. I could make sub catagories for different things. Forests, oceans, wildlife, air quality etc. I could also just make different forums for things that environmental people may be interested in. Like hiking/camping discussions, foraging/gardining. I could have a technology and science area and different things. IDK if people like this are the kind of people who would be very active on a forum but it seems like there's extensive topics I could make and I think it could be good practice. -->
	<!-- idk if people even really just sit and talk about this type of stuff. I'm thinking of maybe just turning it into a genral outdoors forum/page with a secondary thing on environmental awarness etc instead of the other way around idk I mean of seen actevist web sites but they're normally big declarations with places to sign or donate. IDK if I whole discussion board on environmental awareness makes sense. I mean this is mostly just for practice so it doesn't exactly have to make complete sense but it would be good probably to have it kind of make sense. Try to kind of make something that at least a certain group of people would be interested in. I mean I know people talk about the environment but it's mostly just on news and different things. IDK if there's really enough to talk about on a day to day basis to make a whole forum on it. Maybe IDK. I think the thought of a discussion board for people to post ideas about the environment and different technologies and methods for increasing awareness and eco friendly living seems like a good idea but IDK if there's enough people with ideas for that to really make sense as a whole message board. -->
