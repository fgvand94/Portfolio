	<!-- I need to just make a bunch of random websites. Anything. If I can think of something that could actually be good that's fine but just for practice so I remember how to do various things I need to just make a bunch of random websites that have all the basic functionality and structure that's expected in a website and then I can start getting more creative. Also I'm just going to kind of spew this one out as well and then I'll make it look more professional and alter the design as I go -->

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm new to programming and developing my skills in basic web design. HTML CSS and Java Script. I have here a brief overview of my projects. Most of them were projects from my learning resource but there's a couple that I came up with independently.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<h3><a href="../arts and crafts page/artsncrafts.html">Arts and Crafts</a></h3>
			<p>This is a project I did that involved creating a fictional arts and crafts page. It was early on before I was taught much and it was all made from a design that was given to me</p>
			<h3><a href="../repurposedliving/excercise.html">Repurposed living</a></h3>
			<p>This was a project designed for practicing grid in css</p>
			<h3><a href="../Tea Cozy/layout.html">Tea Cozy</a></h3>
			<p>This was a website that i was given the basic layout for how it should look but I wasn't given any instructions as to how the code should look</p>
			<h3><a href="../reflect/reflect.html">Reflect</a></h3>
			<p>This was an idea for a website that I built from scratch. I wasn't given any direction on this. It utilizes more concepts then any of the other things on this short portfolio although it is still in progress.</p>

	<!-- this is okay for now. It's better than bare bones but still looks sort of amature. the reflect page I made looks more professional in the parts that I've done but it still needs work. But I'm trying to learn more about making it look professional and attractive without adding pictures and things. The text placement in the banner is another thing that added an extra something in the reflect page. Small things like that can make a difference. This looks fine but it could be more interesing even with the gray scale scheme. Maybe shift some of the wording a little off center. Or play around with the spacing. Maybe change the colors a little bit and add a bit more accent but keep it monochomatic.  -->
